# POC

###  Requeriments 

- Nodejs v18.12.1
- YARN 

Then in the root of the repo run `yarn turbo build`, this will install  the requeried dependencies

## Project

This is a POC of a booking CRUD system with an authentication method using a single code and API_KEY

### Tools

It uses `turbo` for building all dependencies.


### Database

sqlite database:  `/storage/local`
ORM: `Sequelize`

Could be easily changed for another DB as it is in external layer and it uses an ORM.
